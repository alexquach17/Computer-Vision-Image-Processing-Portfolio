# Computer-Vision-Image-Processing-Portfolio

The associate files in this respository are Python files that perform image processing and computer vision. The functions should be modular and be able to be implemented for a variety of different uses, with little to no editing. The portfolio is split between two main sections, image processing and computer vision. 

Included in the computer vision folder is the term project: a user detection system that tracks user's proximity to another object. In this case, a computer/tv monitor. This system will allow for users of desk to know if a work area has been used and not cleaned. This project will help reduce the spread of COVID as well as help improve the efficiency of cleaning processes
